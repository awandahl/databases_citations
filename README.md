# Bibliographic databases, Citation Databases, and Publication (Citation) Graphs



Here is a **top-down explanation**—starting from **bibliographic databases**, then **citation databases**, explaining **citations and references** and how these fit into the scholarly **publication graph**. 

***

## Bibliographic Metadata Databases

**Bibliographic metadata databases** are archives that **collect and organize descriptive information** about publications—such as authors, titles, publication dates, journal names, abstracts, keywords, and sometimes subject classifications and institutional affiliations.
**Examples:** PubMed, ERIC, university repositories.

- **Purpose:** To help researchers **find** and **access** publications on a topic. They focus on **description**—not on tracking which papers cite which others.
- **Use case:** You use these databases when you want to **discover** literature, conduct systematic searches, or build a bibliography.
- **Content:** They store **metadata** (data about data) but **do not record citation relationships** between papers.

## Citation Databases

**Citation databases** go one step further: they collect **bibliographic metadata** and also track **who cites whom**.
**Examples:** Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar.

- **Purpose:** To enable **citation analysis**—seeing how research builds on previous work, and measuring scholarly impact.
- **Content:** They record **incoming citations** (who cited a paper), **outgoing references** (which papers a work cites), and often provide **citation counts** and **bibliometric indicators** (e.g., h-index, impact factor).
- **Use case:** You use these databases to **measure research impact**, **track citation networks**, or see how a paper is used in the literature.

**Key difference:**
A bibliographic database tells you **what exists**—citation databases tell you **how it is connected** and **how it influences** the scholarly conversation.

## Citations and References in the Research Process

When a **researcher writes a paper**, they include **references** to previous works—these are listed in the bibliography.
Whenever a **paper mentions (cites) another paper** in its main text, this is a **citation**.

- **Reference:** A full bibliographic description of a cited source—placed in the bibliography to allow readers to locate the original work.
- **Citation:** The **act** of mentioning a source in the text—usually with an in-text marker (e.g., (Smith, 2020)) that points to the full reference in the bibliography.
- **Relation:** One paper can cite another in multiple places, but each is **listed once** in the references.

**Example:**
Article B cites Article A—Article B’s bibliography lists Article A, and Article A’s citation count increases by one.

## What Does It Mean for a Publication to “Get a Citation”?

When we say a **publication “gets a citation”**, it means **another scholarly work has mentioned and referenced it** in its bibliography and text.
**Each citation adds to the publication’s citation count**, which is tracked by citation databases.

- **Citation count:** The total number of times a paper has been cited by others. This is a rough **measure of influence**—but not a perfect one, as it doesn’t reflect quality, only visibility.
- **Academic credit:** Cited works are **acknowledged as sources** of ideas, data, or methods.
- **Flow of knowledge:** Citations trace the **influence and spread** of research across the academic world.

**Example:**
If a method published in 2015 is used by five different studies in 2023, the 2015 paper **receives five citations**—its citation count is now five.

## The Publication (Citation) Graph

The **publication graph** (or citation graph) is a **network model** of scholarly communication.

- **Nodes:** Individual publications.
- **Edges:** Citations from one paper (node) to another.
- **In-degree:** The number of incoming edges to a node—this is the **citation count**.

**How the graph works:**

- If **Paper B cites Paper A**, there is an edge from B to A.
- A **highly cited paper** will have **many incoming edges**.
- The graph shows **how knowledge spreads** and **which works are most influential**.
- **Analytics:** Researchers can analyze the graph to find influential papers, detect trends, and understand the structure of a field.

## Summary Table

| **Concept** | **What It Stores** | **Key Feature** | **Example** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Bibliographic metadata database | Title, author, journal, date, abstract, etc. | Describes publications, no citation links | PubMed, ERIC |
| Citation database | Metadata + who cites whom | Tracks citations and references | Web of Science, Scopus |
| Reference | Full details of a cited source | Listed in bibliography | 
| Citation | In-text acknowledgment of a source | Points to reference, may occur multiple times | 
| Publication (citation) graph | Nodes: publications; edges: citations | Models flow of knowledge, supports analysis | 
| “Gets a citation” | Another paper cites the original | Increases citation count, shows visibility |

## Step-by-Step Example

1. **Paper X** publishes a new method and is listed in bibliographic databases.
2. Later, **Paper Y** uses this method, cites **Paper X** in its text and bibliography.
3. The **citation database** records that **Paper X has been cited by Paper Y**.
4. **Paper X’s citation count increases by one**.
5. In the **publication graph**, there is now an edge from **Paper Y** to **Paper X**.
6. If **Paper Z** also cites **Paper X**, the **citation count rises to two**, and the graph gains another edge.
7. The **citation count** becomes a visible indicator of **Paper X’s influence** in the field.

## Why This Matters

- **Bibliographic databases** help you **find** research.
- **Citation databases** show you **how research connects** and **who is influencing whom**.
- **Citations** are the **currency of academic credit**—they track influence and visibility.
- The **publication graph** visualizes the **intellectual structure** of a field, showing which works are central and how ideas spread.

This system—from database to citation to graph—is the backbone of scholarly communication, enabling both discovery and the measurement of impact.

***

**In short:**
You start by **finding papers** in bibliographic databases.
Citation databases **show connections**—who cites whom.
A **citation** means a paper is being recognized and built upon, increasing its influence.
The **publication graph** maps all these connections, showing the flow and impact of ideas in research.
